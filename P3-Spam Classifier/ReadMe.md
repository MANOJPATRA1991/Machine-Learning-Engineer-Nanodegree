## Spam Classifier (Using Naive Bayes)

### Description

In this practice project, we create a model that can classify dataset SMS messages as spam or not spam, based on the training we give to the model. For this project we make use of

Naive-Bayes algorithm and
Bag of Words(BoW) concept which is a term used to specify the problems that have a 'bag of words' or a collection of text data that needs to be worked with.
Concepts learned:

Bag of Words(BoW)
Implementing Bag of Words in scikit-learn
Implementation of Bayes Theorem
Limitations of Bayes Theorem
Implementation of Naive Bayes Algorithm
Implementation of Naive Bayes using scikit-learn
Major advantages of Naive Bayes classification algorithm

# Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree
## Introduction and Foundations
## Project: Titanic Survival Exploration

### Description

In this practice project, we will create decision functions that attempt to predict survival outcomes from the 1912 Titanic disaster based on each passengerâ€™s features, such as sex and age. We will start with a simple algorithm and increase its complexity until we are able to accurately predict the outcomes for at least 80% of the passengers in the provided data. This project will introduce us to some of the concepts of machine learning as we start the Nanodegree program.

### Install

This project requires **Python** and the following Python libraries installed:

- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org)
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)
- [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)

Other requirements:
- [Jupyter Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html)

**NOTE:** If you do not have Python installed yet, it is highly recommended that you install the [Anaconda](http://continuum.io/downloads) distribution of Python, which already has the above packages and more included

### Run

In a terminal or command window, navigate to the top-level project directory `titanic_survival_exploration/` (that contains this README) and run one of the following commands:

```bash
jupyter notebook titanic_survival_exploration.ipynb
```
or
```bash
ipython notebook titanic_survival_exploration.ipynb
```

This will open the Jupyter Notebook software and project file in your web browser.

### Data

The dataset used in this project is included as `titanic_data.csv`. This dataset is provided by Udacity and contains the following attributes:

**Features**
- `pclass` : Passenger Class (1 = 1st; 2 = 2nd; 3 = 3rd)
- `name` : Name
- `sex` : Sex
- `age` : Age
- `sibsp` : Number of Siblings/Spouses Aboard
- `parch` : Number of Parents/Children Aboard
- `ticket` : Ticket Number
- `fare` : Passenger Fare
- `cabin` : Cabin
- `embarked` : Port of Embarkation (C = Cherbourg; Q = Queenstown; S = Southampton)

**Target Variable**
- `survival` : Survival (0 = No; 1 = Yes)
